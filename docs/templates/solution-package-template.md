## Parallelization Assessment

- parallel_mode: `none | limited | enabled`
- why:
- safe_parallel_zones: []
- sequential_constraints: []
- integration_checkpoint:
- max_active_execution_tracks:

Notes:

- `safe_parallel_zones` should be repo-relative artifact path-prefix allowlists such as `src/billing/` or `src/ui/settings/`.
- The current runtime evaluates `safe_parallel_zones` against task `artifact_refs` for `parallel_limited` overlap control.
- If a task falls outside declared zone coverage, it should remain sequential or the solution package should be updated before overlap is allowed.
- `sequential_constraints` should use ordered task-chain strings such as `TASK-API -> TASK-CONSUMER -> TASK-QA`.
- The current runtime applies `sequential_constraints` to full-delivery task boards as effective dependency overlays.
- Tasks named later in a chain should stay queued until the earlier task order is satisfied.
