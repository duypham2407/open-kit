# Solution Package: <Migration Name>

## Goal

- State the target migration or upgrade outcome and the intended end-state stack.

## Preserved Invariants

- Layout or presentation details that must remain equivalent.
- Core flows, contracts, and business logic that must remain equivalent.
- Explicitly allowed behavior changes, if any.

## Baseline Snapshot

- Current versions, important dependencies, runtime assumptions, and known fragile areas.

## Migration Blockers And Seams

- Framework-coupled blockers that make direct upgrade unsafe.
- Seams, adapters, or compatibility shims to create before or during the migration.

## Upgrade Sequence

## Parallelization Assessment

- parallel_mode: `none | limited | enabled`
- why:
- safe_parallel_zones: []
- sequential_constraints: []
- integration_checkpoint:
- max_active_execution_tracks:

Notes:

- `safe_parallel_zones` should be repo-relative artifact path-prefix allowlists such as `src/migrations/` or `src/adapters/legacy-api/`.
- The current runtime evaluates `safe_parallel_zones` against task or slice `artifact_refs` for `parallel_limited` overlap control.
- If a task or slice falls outside declared zone coverage, it should remain sequential or the solution package should be updated before overlap is allowed.
- `sequential_constraints` may record intended ordered chains such as `SLICE-BASELINE -> SLICE-ADAPTERS -> SLICE-PARITY`.
- Current runtime enforcement of `sequential_constraints` applies only to full-delivery task boards.
- For migration slices today, record explicit slice `depends_on` edges for any order that must be enforced at runtime.

## Migration Slice Rules

- Only create parallel slices after the preserved invariants and strategy are stable.
- Every slice must record preserved invariants, compatibility risks, rollback notes, and parity verification targets.
- If safe slices cannot be defined cleanly, keep the migration sequential.

## Compatibility Risks

## Parity Verification

- Baseline evidence to compare against after each slice.
- Critical smoke or regression paths.
- Manual or automated checks that prove behavior equivalence.

## Rollback Notes
