# Skill: Writing Solution Packages

## Context

This skill is used by `Solution Lead`. It turns an approved `Product Lead` scope package into an execution-ready solution package that `FullstackAgent`, `Code Reviewer`, and `QAAgent` can trust.

Each solution package should be detailed enough that implementation can proceed without guesswork and review can trace decisions back to approved scope.

For full delivery, the sequence is strict:
- `Product Lead` writes the scope package in `full_product`
- that scope package is approved
- `Solution Lead` then writes the solution package in `full_solution`

Do not write the solution package in parallel with `Product Lead` scope work.

## Core Rules of a Good Plan

1. **Feature slices first**: start with feature-level slices, sequencing, and integration checkpoints before any optional micro-task breakdown.
2. **Executable boundaries**: each slice should be coherent enough to hand to implementation and review without hidden assumptions.
3. **Exact file paths**: specify the exact absolute path or repository-relative path for every file to create or edit when file targets are known.
4. **Validation flow**: solution-package validation must match the active workflow mode. Full-delivery logic work should be TDD-first when the repository has suitable test tooling. Migration work should prioritize preserved invariants, blocker-decoupling steps, compatibility checks, staged verification, and targeted tests only where they are truly reliable and helpful. If the repo does not define a standard command yet, the solution package must state the missing validation path instead of inventing one.
5. **Upstream contract first**: in full delivery, every major decision in the solution package must trace back to the approved `Product Lead` scope package rather than replacing or redefining product intent.

## Anti-Bloat Rules

- do not open with generic architecture narration when the real need is an execution-ready solution package
- do not repeat the same scope detail from the scope package in every slice
- do not produce more slices than the repository or feature actually needs
- do not expand slices into micro-steps unless implementation would otherwise be ambiguous
- do not create placeholder sections with no concrete decisions inside them
- prefer one recommended path over multiple equivalent options unless the decision is still genuinely unresolved

## Execution Process

### Step 1: Context Gathering
Make sure you have read:
- `docs/scope/YYYY-MM-DD-<feature>.md`
- the current workflow stage and approval context
- `context/core/code-quality.md`

Before writing, confirm that in full delivery the scope package came from `Product Lead` in `full_product` and is approved for `Solution Lead` to use in `full_solution`.

### Step 2: Write the Solution Package

Create `docs/solution/YYYY-MM-DD-<feature>.md` using this structure:

```markdown
# Solution Package: [Feature Name]

## Dependencies
- Are any additional packages required? (`npm install X`, `pip install Y`)
- Are any environment variables required?

## Solution Slices

List the major slices first. For each slice, follow a validation-aware structure:

### [ ] Slice 1: [Specific outcome]
- **Files**: `path/to/file.ext`
- **Goal**: [Brief description]
- **Validation Command**: `[test/build/typecheck/smoke/manual verification command for this step, or an explicit note that no repo-native validation command exists yet]`
- **Details**:
  - State the baseline or expected change for this slice
  - State the implementation or upgrade action
  - State dependencies, reviewer focus points, and how the result will be verified honestly

## Dependency Graph
- Record which slices must stay sequential.
- Record which slices may run in parallel safely only when the solution package explicitly documents why parallel execution is safe.
- Name the critical path in one short line.

## Validation Matrix
- Map acceptance or invariant targets to the real validation path.

## Optional Execution Breakdown
- Add micro-steps only when execution needs them.
```

### Step 3: Review and Refine
- Are the solution slices coherent and traceable?
- Does any slice still hide too many unrelated surfaces? -> If yes, split it.
- In full mode, does any logic task skip the "write test first" step without justification? -> Add the test requirement.
- In full mode, does the package clearly depend on the approved `Product Lead` scope package instead of redefining requirements? -> Rewrite it.
- In migration mode, does the solution package mix rewrite work into the migration instead of isolating blockers and proving parity? -> Rewrite the sequence.
- In migration mode, does the solution package rely on fake TDD instead of baseline, compatibility, and regression evidence? -> Rewrite the validation guidance.
- Does the solution package cover all acceptance criteria from the scope package?

## Anti-Patterns
- A solution package written before the `Product Lead` scope package is approved.
- A solution package that redefines product scope instead of designing from the approved scope package.
- A solution package that starts with micro-checklists but never explains the feature slices, dependencies, or integration checkpoint.
- A solution package that reads like a generic architecture essay instead of an execution-ready delivery artifact.
- No test guidance or test command, and no explicit note that the repo lacks a standard command.
- A solution package that does not specify which files need to be edited.
